1.13.5 (2018 August 16)
=====================

Bugfixes
--------
* Fixed setting proxy with env vars (``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY``, ``NO_PROXY``)

1.13.4 (2018 August 9)
=====================

Bugfixes
--------
* Enforce ``shelve`` to use ``dbm.dumb``/``dumbdbm`` modules for Python 3.x/2.7 respectively to prevent hiccups on a big amount of generated checkpoint. Was caught on macos X (``ndbm`` backend).

Enhancements
------------
* New command ``batch_scoring_deployment_aware`` for scoring with new deployment aware routes.

1.13.3 (2018 June 20)
=====================

Bugfixes
--------
* Changes the sequence of config file look up. A config file in the working directory will now take precedence over a config file in the userâ€™s home directory.

Documentation
-------------
* Include ``README.rst`` into distribution as long description.

1.13.2 (2018 February 26)
=========================

Bugfixes
--------
* Fix wheel installation for Python 2.

1.13.1 (2018 February 26)
=========================

Bugfixes
--------
* Fix package installation in Python 3 environments.

1.13.0 (2017 November 10)
=========================

Enhancements
------------
* Brings back support for legacy predictions (api/v1) and a new parameter for specifying api version (``--api_version``).
  Check ``batch_scoring --help`` for a list of valid options and the default value.
* Adds  ``--no_verify_ssl`` argument for disabling SSL verification and ``--ca_bundle``
  for specifying certificate(s) of trusted Certificate Authorities.
* Default for timeout is now None, meaning that the code does not enforce a timeout for operations to the server. This allows completion of runs with higher numbers of threads, particularly in MacOS. The value remains modifiable, and 30 seconds is a reasonable value in most cases.

Bugfixes
--------
* An issue which caused exit codes to not be set correctly from executables installed via the standalone installer
  has been addressed. The exit codes will now be set correctly.
* An issue which caused script crashes if one or more boolean options were specified in the config file.

1.12.1 (2017 August 14)
=======================

Bugfixes
--------
* Updates the distribution metadata to include modules critical to the functioning of this library.

1.12.0 (2017 August 9)
======================

Enhancements
------------
* Batch scoring now works with Python 3.6 on Windows (offline installs require 3.5 though)
* Logs now include version, retry attempts and whether output file was removed.
* New argument `no-resume` that allows you to start new batch-scoring run from scratch without being questioned about previous runs.
* The version of the dependency `trafaret` has been pinned to `0.10.0` to deal with a breaking change in the interface
  of that package.


Documentation
-------------
* A new "Version Compatibility" section has been added to the README to help surface to users any
  incompatibilities between versions of `batch_scoring` and versions of `DataRobot`.


1.11.0 (2017 May 30)
====================

New Features
------------
* New parameter `field_size_limit` allows users to specify a larger maximum field
  size than the Python `csv` module normally allows. Users can use a larger number
  for this value if they encounter issues with very large text fields, for example.
  Please note that using larger values for this parameter may cause issues with
  memory consumption.

Bugfixes
--------
* Previously, files whose first few lines did not fit within 512KB would error during
  the auto-sampler (which finds a reasonable number of rows to send with each batch).
  This issue hsa been fixed by adding a fallback to a default of 10 lines per
  batch in these cases. This parameter can still be overridden by using the
  `n_samples` parameter.

* Fix issue when client error message wasn't logged properly.

1.10.2 (2017 May 9)
================
* Set default timeout on server response to infinity.

1.10.1 (2017 April 27)
================

  subprocess lifecycle control.

* Source code split into more mostly isolated modules.

1.9.0 (2016 December 1)

  This should greatly improve performance.

* fixed hang of batch-scoring script on CSV parse errors

* added summary of run at the end of script output with full list of errors,
    warnings and total stats.

* fixed error when trying to report multiline CSV error in fast mode

* Run all tests against Windows

1.8.7 (2016 November 1)
==================
* --pred_name parameter is documented. Potentially backward incompatible change:
    Previously, 1.0 class was used as positive result for binary predictions,
    now last class in lexical order is used

* Fixed memory leak and performance problem caused by unrestricted batch-generator

* internal check and error avoidance logic for requests that are too large

* docker and docker-compose files for dockerized run of tests and script

* change how csv dialects are passed around in attempt to fix a bug on Windows.

1.8.0 (2016 June 13)
==================
* use chardet module `chardet <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet>`_ to
  attempt to detect character encoding

* use standard lib csv module to attempt to discover CSV dialect
